# Breakout2D Clone
###### Martin Fennell, G00291266
## Introduction

This repo is for my project for the 3rd year module Graphics programming, which I have been using HTML Canvas to design a breakout2D game to show my understanding of how you can use the canvas to design graphical programs with just HTML5/JS. The project will show my learning outcome and include technologies such as [HTML Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript) [Animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame), [Transformations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Transformations) among a few more.
#### Aims
The aims of the project are for me to learn and show my understanding of how HTML5 and other technologies can be used to visualize data with a small amount of code on a web page by using different technologies.
#### How to use the application
- Download a zip of repo or use `git clone`.
- Open the directory in the location it has been downloaded to.
- Open `project.html` in a web browser such as `chrome`.
- Use the `right/left` keys on the keyboard to move the paddle.
- Press the `enter` key to start the game.
- Break all of the blocks to win the game.

#### Known issues
- There is an issue where the ball is getting stuck on the bottom of the paddle buggy fashion and then releasing at a very high speed.
- Another issue I have noticed is the ball is not changing direction when it is in a collision with two blocks.

#### References
- A large part of my knowledge came from my course work however I found the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) very usefull
- The game idea was based on the [breakout game](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript) on the MDN
##### Documentation
- I used a webapp called [dillenger.io](https://dillinger.io/) to created this documentation.
